# PIG LATIN RESTFUL TRANSLATOR API



## Objective:

Users can translate text to Pig Latin.

Create a REST Api that:
* Handles Registration ( Confirmation needed )
* Authentication And Authorization
* Receives content and Translate it to Pig Latin ( save this resource to be fetch )
  > ex:  POST /posts  , GET /posts/1  <-- content should be translated to Pig Latin.


## Requirements:

* Only authenticated users ( active ) can post content to be translated
* At least an 85% test coverage
* Any database can be used ( even in memory )
* An beautiful algorithm for the Pig Latin translation.
* Be RESTFUL
* Provide simple client for accessing the API or Curl request / Postman etc.



## Pig Latin System

Basically, the Pig Latin system used here works as follows:

* Words that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) simply have "WAY" appended to the end of the word.
* Words that start with a consonant have all consonant letters up to the first vowel moved to the end of the word (as opposed to just the first consonant letter), and "AY" is appended. ('Y' is counted as a vowel in this context)
* The algorithm incorporates the following features and special case functionality:
  * Ensures proper capitalization
  * Correct upper case and lower case formatting
  * Correctly translates "qu" (e.g., ietquay instead of uietqay)
  * Correctly translates contractions
  * Hyphenated words are treated as two words
  * Words may consist of alphabetic characters only (A-Z and a-z)
  * All punctuation, numerals, symbols and whitespace are not modified
  * Differentiates between "Y" as vowel and "Y" as consonant
    (e.g. yellow = elloyay and style = ylestay) â€” except for a very few exceptions

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

  1. This repo assumes you have a node.js environment ready, preferably with the previously described versions of npm and node.

  2. Some necessary global npm packages:
    ```
    $ npm install -g sequelize sequelize-cli pg

    // versions at time of development:
    // C:\Programing\nvm\NodeJS
    // +-- pg@6.1.2
    // +-- sequelize@3.27.0
    // `-- sequelize-cli@2.5.1
    ```

  3. You also need to setup a PostgreSQL environment and initialize the following:
    > open a connection to the database: `sudo -u postgres psql postgres`
    > create a database named "ventureoak_dev": `CREATE DATABASE ventureoak_dev; CREATE EXTENSION unaccent; CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
    > setup a user named: "root" with password "root_pass": `CREATE USER root WITH PASSWORD 'root_pass';`
    > grant access to database "ventureoak_dev" to user "root": `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ventureoak_dev TO root;`
    >
    > If you already have your environment setup and want another username/password, simply update the file "config/database.json".

#### Getting started

1. To get started, clone the repo, `cd` into it and then install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

2. Next, migrate the database (this step assumes you already created an empty database called "ventureoak_dev"):
  ```
  $ sequelize db:migrate
  $ sequelize db:seed:all
  ```

3. Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
  ```
  $ npm test
  ```

4. If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the API in a local server:
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

5. Visualize the API documentation on: [http://localhost:3666/](http://localhost:3666/docs). This will allow you to easily see what routes are available, what information each route requires and to manually test and interact with the API. If you wish, feel free to access each route separately by their address in the browser (for example [http://localhost:3666/payslip](http://localhost:3666/payslip)) but remember this is an 'API only' project. No front-end whatsoever was developed and all route returns will be in a JSON object.

6. As a friendly reminder, you can use the credentials `demo1@mail.com`, `demo2@mail.com` or `demo3@mail.com` with the password `password` to authenticate. For details on permissions, please refer to the seeder file [pre_populate_db](database/seeders/20170202021739-pre_populate_db.js).

## Assumptions

* FrontEnd
  > Since I use swagger for documentation and manual testing of each API route, I saved some effort and did not develop any kind of FrontEnd interface. Swagger usually provides a simple yet good enough interface to interact with the API routes, but if FontEnd is also a requirement, please do give a description of what be acceptable and allow me a couple more days to complete it.

* Translation requirement: "Correct upper case and lower case formatting"
  > This is ensured by never modifying the original world, besides adding the suffix or moving the first consonants to the end and then adding the suffix. The suffix is always lowercase. This means that any capitalized letter stays capitalized and any lowercase letter stays lowercase (eg. 'house' is translated to 'ousehay', 'hoUSe' is translated to 'oUSehay'). The only exception to this is when the word has the first letter capitalized, which transforms the letter to lowercase and capitalizes the first letter of the translated word (eg. 'House' is translated to 'Ousehay')

* Compound words and Hyphenated words
  > Hyphenated word handling is required by the exercise. The approach taken was to utilize a dictionary created through [Wikipedia's List of contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_English_contractions). For ambiguous contractions like "he's" (which could mean for example "he is" or "he was" or "he has"), a default translation was selected at random. A more robust algorithm could interpret the text and select the appropriate expansion.

  > Compound word handling is not required by the exercise, but most Pig Latin resources mention they should be handled to increase complexity. This functionality was added to the translate_text() function with the same dictionary approach, based on [Many Thing's Compound Word List](http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/a/words.php?f=compound_words).

  > It is worth to note that I do not consider these dictionaries to be exhaustive or completely reliable/accurate. Many of the represented contractions or compound words are or may be in linguistic grey areas filled with controversy and debate. They serve the purpose of demonstration and would require an in-depth study of the English language to be fit for a production application.

* Authentication / Authorization system
  > The implemented authentication/authorization system is based on JWT. When a registered user logs in with valid credentials, an encrypted token is issued, based on the id of the user and the expiration date (12h after the login request). It is assumed that the FrontEnd will ensure the storage of this token and use it in each request to the API. This approach assumes that it is the responsibility of the FrontEnd to destroy/clean the storage to invalidate the token and thus no logout route is implemented in the API.
